    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Call of Duty/Warzone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Call of Duty is a very popular video game series published by Activision. Recently, its free-to-play game Warzone has come into great popularity, specifically with the rise of Battle Royale type games. With this rise has also come a very large community that is very competitive. These players started to realize that the game's lack of a ranking system did not match up with their own matchmaking experience. Thus, players have started to wonder if there is a hidden skill-based matchmaking system present in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would someone care about their matchmaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all gamers care about their gaming experience. It's obviously not fun to consistently lose, but its also not fun to consistently win. Finding the balance, is very important to staying interested in a game for a long time. So, both from a consumer and developer standpoint, matchmaking is integral to keeping a video game relevant. While this is the case, not being able to see your performance in relation to matchmaking is removing a significant part of the experience from players. In other very popular video games such as League of Legends, Apex Legends, Valorant, and even FIFA all show their players their ranking and progression through the ranked tier system. In Warzone, such a system does not exist, and this leads players to question the skill levels of their opponents and themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    " In addition, there is also the possibility that Activision has a financial incentive to modify matchmaking, especially at the content creator level. The reasoning behind this is that content creators hold great influence over potential customers, and giving them a good experience might lead to more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What exactly is skill based matchmaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skill based matchmaking is a system that matches players in a game based on some ranking. This ranking can be whatever metric the developers choose, but is often implemented as an ELO score or a custom MMR (matchmaking rating) score fitting the game's qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the goal of our project?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be exploring two main questions for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question will be \"Is there skill-based matchmaking in Call of Duty: Warzone?\". This question is a very common one amongst the COD user base and being members of this user base, we wanted to find out an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question is arguably juicier because it puts Activision in the hot seat. We will be trying to answer \"Does Activision purposefully lower the matchmaking difficulty of content creators?\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that the game has a very passionate community, learning the answers to these questions can be very insightful for the input fans want to give to developers. For the content creators, players who are also passionate viewers of COD on Twitch or YouTube might rethink their opinions of whoever they watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the specific nature of this project, we had to find creative ways to collect data regarding Call of Duty matchmaking information. Luckily, there is a Call of Duty API that enables developers to look at past match data and stats for specific players. However, Call of Duty's official API enforces a setting where accounts must set their visibility to public for their profiles to be viewable. However, some third party APIs aggregate data across games and paint a clearer picture of players' statistics. One of these is [WZStats.gg](http://wzstats.gg) (Warzone Stats) and they show detailed per match data. By using their website and its API, we are able to get the data of many players that will help to inform our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is a manual process to set your profile to public visibility, it is likely that better-skilled players are going to be the ones with visible profiles. This potentially limits our visibility into the player skill spectrum. If there is skill-based matchmaking, the initial accounts, and their respective game history, that we are analyzing, will be biased towards higher tier skill levels because these players care a lot more about their stats than lower-skilled players and would be more likely to set their profiles to public. However, if there is no skill-based matchmaking, then the game lobbies will be entirely random as far as skill is concerned (there could be other factors such as network latency and global location). With random lobbies, we will hypothetically be able to tap into the entire spectrum of players if we analyze enough games."
